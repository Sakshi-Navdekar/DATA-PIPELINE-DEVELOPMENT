"Description": This project is a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipeline built using Python. It demonstrates how to automate the data preprocessing process using libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn. The script reads raw data from a CSV file (data.csv), handles missing values, encodes categorical columns using one-hot encoding, and normalizes numerical columns. After transformation, the cleaned and processed data is saved into a new CSV file named processed_data.csv. This pipeline is useful for preparing data before using it in machine learning or data analysis projects. The project is simple, easy to understand, and can be run using any Python environment like VS Code.This project helped me learn how to handle real data and build useful tools in data science.
